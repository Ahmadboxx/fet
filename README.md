# Hello World
My name is Ahmad
I have learned alot in this course about how to use github and now I'm able to publish a site on the Internet

with all my appreciation

I'm explaining Growth mindset in the following :

you can develope your ability by hard working which will improve your talents also,

for this you have to ignore fear and don't fear from challenges and looking forward 

you can sense the difficulty that is ahead of the student which it should make him better and stronger to face that challenges.
 reminders to my self to keep in a growth mindset:
 
1-No pain = no gain

2-Ignore criticism

3-Avoid challenges
